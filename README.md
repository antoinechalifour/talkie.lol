## Stack

### Signaling server

The source code can be found [here](./tree/master/packages/server).

The signaling server is a [GraphQL API](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), written using :

- ‚úÖ TypeScript
- üöÄ [Apollo server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) as a GraphQL server
- üÑ∫ [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Dependency Injection using [Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix)
- üì¶ Redis as a database / pubsub

### Web app

The source code can be found [here](./tree/master/packages/web).

The frontend is a [React app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using :

- ‚úÖ TypeScript
- üöÄ [urql as a GraphQL client](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql)
- üíÖ [styled-components for styling](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- üé• [framer motion for animations](https://github.com/framer/motion)

This project extensively uses new APIs such as CSS Grid or CSS custom properties.

## Development environment

### Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need

- Docker and docker-compose
- Yarn
- A version of Node supported by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app).

### Running locally

To start the app :

- Install dependencies using `yarn` in the project root
- Run `docker-compose up` in the project root (this will start Redis and the signaling server in watch mode using `ts-node`)
- Run `yarn start` in the `packages/web` directory (this will start the front-end)

## Deployment

```shell script
# Configure the remote machine (install Nginx and Docker)
ansible-playbook infra/playbooks/install.yml

# Configure the reverse proxy
ansible-playbook infra/playbooks/reverse_proxy.yml

# Deploy the app
ansible-playbook infra/playbooks/talkie.yml
```
